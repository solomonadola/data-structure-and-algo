# Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, a one-stop destination for mastering data structures and algorithms. This repository is a collection of solutions implemented in **TypeScript**, **Python**, and possibly **Java**. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of data structures and algorithms through practical implementation.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Fundamental Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, and more.
2. **Complex Data Structures**: Trees, Graphs, Heaps, and more.
3. **Algorithmic Techniques**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and more.

Each section contains:

- A brief explanation of the concept
- Detailed implementation guides
- Sample problems with solutions in TypeScript, Python, and Java
